# **Hello world, I'm Caroline!** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a civil engineer with a passion for technology, now transitioning into the tech world. With a background in numbers, analysis, and calculations, I'm learning **Python** and loving every step of the journey. I recently joined the Santander **AWS** Practitioner bootcamp, and I'm eager to dive deeper into this field.

*I believe in sharing knowledgeâ€”it's one of the best ways to learn. I'm working toward building clean, well-organized code and exploring new tech concepts. I also enjoy art, architecture, reading, and working out. Just like in technology, I believe in always staying in motion, constantly learning and improving.*
